  rundown: Hack on Kubic via KVM
  description: >-
    If you want to play around with Kubic in a libvirt/KVM environment you can use our automation tool to setup a cluster of X nodes in one go.

    Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/kubic-project/automation/blob/master/caasp-kvm/README.md) to prepare your host system with the necessary dependencies (e.g. libvirt)

    and then to build e.g. a 1 master, 2 worker cluster using the latest kubic image, run from the automation/caasp-kvm directory:

    ```bash ./caasp-kvm --build -m 1 -w 2 --image channel://kubic```

   Velum is a dashboard that manages your SUSE CaaS Platform cluster. With Velum, you will be able to :

   * Bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster with a simple click.
   
   * Manage your Kubernetes: cluster adding and removing nodes from your cluster, monitoring faulty nodes, etc.
